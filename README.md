# Grayscale to RGB

This folder contains foraminifera (forams) sample images from six targeted species and other species. There are 1437 samples in total.

The six species and the number of samples are:
- G. Bulloides		178
- G. Ruber			182
- G. Sacculifer		150
- N. Dutertrei		151
- N. Incompta		174
- N. Pachyderma		152
- Others			450

We took 16 images under different lighting conditions for each sample. These images are aligned but the order of light source directions are not the same for all the samples. The images were cropped and converted to grayscale images. Each images of sample are put in a separate folder under the species folder.

Each folder is named as:
<data_taken>_<trial_id> <species_name> <location_label> <sample_size_range>

The "trial_id" is the index of the image set taken during that day.
